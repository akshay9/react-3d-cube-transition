# react-3d-cube-transition Demo

This example demonstrates usage of react-3d-cube-transition package in the parent directory for development purposes.

Note: This example links react-3d-cube-transition library from the parent folder and not from npm. Hence it is meant to be used during debuging.

Check the `standalone-example` folder in parent directory for an simpler example based on a pre-built `react-3d-cube-transition` library from npm repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akshay9/react-3d-cube-transition
cd react-3d-cube-transition
yarn install
yarn start
```
```bash
# Inside another terminal
cd example
yarn start
```
